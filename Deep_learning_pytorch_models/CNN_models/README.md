# Convolutional Neural Networks

1. The exercises are independent but doing them in order might be useful.
2. Instead of just running cells, Try writing the code.
3. Most of the cells are like templates i.e. you can reuse them for a particular job ( e.g. Showing all images in a batch) with some modifications.
